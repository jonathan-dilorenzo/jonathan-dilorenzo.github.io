<p>Welcome! I'm currently a <a href="https://csci.williams.edu/people/faculty/molly-feldman/">Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a> (go üêÆ!). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> in 2020, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hirsh/">Haym Hirsh</a>. Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Cornell and my B.A. in Mathematics & Computer Science from <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>I'm interested in <em>bridging the gap</em> between powerful <em>computational methods</em> and the <em>human-centered</em> world. Specifically, my work considers how methods that are newly practical, 
such as program synthesis and crowdsourcing, can be adapted to solve complex human problems in meaningful ways. As part of this work, I've considered how we can <a href="chi2018.html">diagnose math errors automatically</a>,
<a href="splashe2019.html">adapt synthesis engines for CS1 students</a>, and <a>the design behind how we write with crowds</a>. This work has been made possible by my <a href="collaborators.html">great collaborators</a>!</p>
