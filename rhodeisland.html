<h2>My Guide to Rhode Island</h2>

<p>I am a born and bred Rhode Islander, so obviously I have very strong opinions about Rhode Island's beautiful places and its excellent food.
Below is the general route for my well-tested <strong>1 day tour</strong> from Providence to Providence.</p>

<p>I would also strongly
recommend taking a tour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_County,_Rhode_Island">South County</a> from Narragansett to Westerly
along Route 1A. </p>

<p>Any questions? Want to debate me about pizza? <a href="https://twitter.com/feldmanmolly">Tweet</a> at me.</p>
